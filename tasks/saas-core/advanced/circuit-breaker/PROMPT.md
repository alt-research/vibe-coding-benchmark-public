# Advanced Circuit Breaker

Implement production-grade circuit breaker with advanced features.

## Requirements
1. Three states: Closed, Open, Half-Open
2. Adaptive failure thresholds based on request volume
3. Bulkhead isolation per service
4. Multiple fallback strategies (cache, default, degraded)
5. Metrics collection and alerting
6. Request hedging for latency
7. Circuit breaker per endpoint granularity
8. Graceful degradation coordination
